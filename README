# MathLens - Solve Math Problems with a Single Click

How to Use:
After building and running the project, you can either use front or back camera (if you don't have one of these cameras, the app accounts for this). If you do not have a camera, you can choose photos from your photo library. After choosing or taking a picture, you can crop the picture by drawing a cropping rectangle with one finger. Now, you can click calculate at the problem left corner. Then the view changes and has an alert with the answer or error if problem reading in the problem.

Used APIs:
- OpenCV : open source library is used to analysis pictures and convert the picture into a black and white image and find individual characters from the image given to the app
- TesseractOCR : open source library which is used to recognize the letters. Using tesseract on virtual machine, I was able to train tesseract to mathematical equations, italicized letters, and english letters.

Features to Add:
- Handle errors in reading problems
- Add ability to rotate, move, and zoom
- Matrix arithmetic
- Matrix algebra
- Train tesseract to greek letters, treat these as either pi or variables
